# Use the SDK to join a meeting with an Android device

This article shows you how to enable the core  **Skype for Business** anonymous meeting join scenario in your Android app. iOS developers should read
[Use the SDK to join a meeting with an iOS device](HowToJoinMeeting_iOS.md). 

If the anonymous meeting your app joins is hosted in a **Skype for Business Online** service and 
your app is not enabled for Skype for Business preview features, then your app must get a **discovery Url** and an **anonymous meeting token** to join. A meeting Url does not give you 
meeting access in this scenario. Read [Use the App SDK and the Trusted Application API to join an Online meeting - Android](HowToJoinOnlineMeeting_Android.md)

After completing the steps in this article, your app can join a **Skype for Business** video meeting with a
meeting URL. No **Skype for Business** credentials are used to join the meeting.

>[!NOTE]
Be sure to read [Getting started with Skype App SDK development](GettingStarted.md) to learn how to configure your Android project for the **Skype for Business** App SDK.  In particular, the following steps assume you have added the _ConversationHelper_ class to your source to let you complete the scenario with a minimum of code. 

1. Initialize the **App SDK** application by calling the static _com.microsoft.office.sfb.appsdk.Application.getInstance(Context)_ method:

   ```java
   Application mApplication = com.microsoft.office.sfb.appsdk.Application.getInstance(this.getBaseContext());
   AnonymousSession mAnonymousSession = null;
   Conversation mConversation = null;
   ```
   >Note: Be sure to select the Application object in the _com.microsoft.office.sfb.appsdk_ package!
   
1. Enable platform preview features and set wifi required for audio/video
   ```java
   mApplication.getConfigurationManager().enablePreviewFeatures(true);
   mApplication.getConfigurationManager().setRequireWiFiForAudio(true);
   mApplication.getConfigurationManager().setRequireWiFiForVideo(true);
   mApplication.getConfigurationManager().setMaxVideoChannelCount(2);
   
   ```
1. Start joining the meeting by calling _Application.joinMeetingAnonymously(String displayName, URI meetingUri)_   

   ```java
            mAnonymousSession = mApplication
                    .joinMeetingAnonymously(
                            getString(
                                    R.string.userDisplayName), meetingURI);
   
   ```
   > Note: all of the SDK’s interfaces must be used only from the application main thread (main run loop).  Notifications are delivered in the same thread as well.  As a result, no synchronization around the SDK’s interfaces is required.  The SDK, however, may create threads for internal purposes.      

1. Get the [**Conversation**](https://ucwa.skype.com/reference/appSDK/Android/com/microsoft/office/sfb/appsdk/Conversation.html) object that encapsulates the meeting from the [**AnonymousSession**](https://ucwa.skype.com/reference/appSDK/Android/com/microsoft/office/sfb/appsdk/AnonymousSession.html) object by calling _getConversation()_ on the anonymous session.  
   ```java
     mConversation = mAnonymousSession.getConversation();
   ```  

1. Show video codec license

    As per the license terms, before you start video for the first time after install, you **must** prompt the user to accept the Microsoft end-user license (also included in the SDK).  
    This is required to proceed with features that potentially use video codecs.

    This code snippet shows the use of the new Skype App SDK **"setEndUserAcceptedVideoLicense"** api. 
    Until this method is called, any attempt to use those features will fail.
    Once the api has been called, the user is considered in acceptance of the third party video codec license that we use to support video.  Subsequent meetings do not require the license acceptance.  

    [!code-java [sample](VideoLicense_Android.md)]  
1. Connect the conversation property callback to the [**Conversation**](https://ucwa.skype.com/reference/appSDK/Android/com/microsoft/office/sfb/appsdk/Conversation.html) object returned in the previous step.
   ```java
       mConversation.addOnPropertyChangedCallback(
           new ConversationPropertyChangeListener()); 
   ```
   - Declare a callback class to handle conversation property change Notifications
   ```java
      ```java
      /**
     * Callback implementation for listening for conversation property changes.
     */
    class ConversationPropertyChangeListener extends
            Observable.OnPropertyChangedCallback {
        ConversationPropertyChangeListener() {
        }

        /**
         * onProperty changed will be called by the Observable instance on a property change.
         *
         * @param sender     Observable instance.
         * @param propertyId property that has changed.
         */
        @Override
        public void onPropertyChanged(Observable sender, int propertyId) {
            Conversation conversation = (Conversation) sender;
            if (propertyId == Conversation.STATE_PROPERTY_ID) {
                if (conversation.getState() == Conversation.State.ESTABLISHED) {

                    Log.e("SkypeCall", conversation
                            .getMeetingInfo()
                            .getMeetingDescription()
                            + " is established");

                    try {
                        runOnUiThread(new Runnable() {
                            @Override
                            public void run() {
                                //Update application UI to show conversation is established.
                                //Open video call fragment.

                            }
                        });
                    } catch (Exception e) {
                        Log.e("SkypeCall", "exception on meeting started");
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
   ```

   ```
1. When the state of the conversation changes to Conversation.State.ESTABLISHED, construct a ConversationHelper object. Pass the following objects:
   * The [**Conversation**](https://ucwa.skype.com/reference/appSDK/Android/com/microsoft/office/sfb/appsdk/Conversation.html) object returned in a prior step
   * the [**Application.DevicesManager**](https://ucwa.skype.com/reference/appSDK/Android/com/microsoft/office/sfb/appsdk/DevicesManager.html)
   * A **TextureView** control to show a preview of outgoing video
   * A view such as a **RelativeLayout** to contain the **MMVRSurfaceview** that will show incoming video.

   ```java
         //Initialize the conversation helper with the established conversation,
         //the SfB App SDK devices manager, the outgoing video TextureView,
         //The view container for the incoming video, and a conversation helper
         //callback.
         mConversationHelper = new ConversationHelper(
                 mConversation,
                 mDevicesManager,
                 previewVideoTextureView,
                 mParticipantVideoSurfaceView,
                 this);
   ```
   >Note: The [ConversationHelper class](./ConversationHelperCodeList.md) makes it possible to start a video conversation and
   handle related events on the conversation, participants, and video streams with fewer lines of application code. You may not want to use the **ConversationHelper** if your 
   application scenario has requirements that are not covered in this how to article. In that case, take the **ConversationHelper** as a starting point and modify or 
   extend it to suite your requirements.

1. Start the incoming and outgoing meeting video.

   >Note: as per the license terms, before you start video for the first time after install, you must prompt the user to accept the Microsoft end-user license (also included in the SDK). Please refer step 5 - Show video codec license for the sample code.

   ```java
         //Start up the incoming and outgoing video
         mConversationHelper.startOutgoingVideo();
         mConversationHelper.startIncomingVideo();
   ```


1. Implement the **ConversationHelper.ConversationCallback** interface

   ```java
     implements ConversationHelper.ConversationCallback
   ```
