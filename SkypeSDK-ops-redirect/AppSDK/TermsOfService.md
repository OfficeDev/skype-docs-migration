The Distributable Code uses H.264 AVC video, which requires that you obtain a distribution license from MPEG LA (go to http://www.mpegla.com to obtain such license).  You must not distribute any application that includes Distributable Code and is capable of rendering local or remote video until you obtain this video license.  You must indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Microsoft from any claims, including attorneys’ fees, that arise due to the failure to obtain the MPEG LA license as required above.**  

   b. **Distributable Code.** The software contains code that you are permitted to distribute in applications you develop if you comply with the terms below.

    - modify or distribute the source code of any Distributable Code so that any part of it becomes subject to an Excluded License. An Excluded License is one that requires, as a condition of use, modification or distribution, that

      - others have the right to modify it.
