# Versioning and staying up to date

We anticipate that the SDK will be updated frequently with new capabilities.

* Once the SDK is generally available, weâ€™ll make every effort to ensure API back-compatibility with previous versions.  We will communicate any breaking changes clearly.
* To allow the SDK to move forward quickly, our guidance is to update to the latest SDK at your earliest convenience.  Where an app is based on a version of the SDK that is older than six months, then you may need to update it so that:
  * We can investigate an issue report
  * It continues to work against Skype for Business Online or the latest Skype for Business Server CU; such occurrences should be rare and will be communicated with good notice.
* Fixes to bugs will typically be delivered only in new versions of the SDK and **not back-ported** to previous versions.
