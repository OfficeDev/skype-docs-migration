## Creating a Skype for Business bot

The Skype for Business bots are created using the [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/).  Bots created with the framework can easily be configured to work with Skype for Business.  See the [Microsoft Bot Framework Overview](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/) to learn how to:
1.	Build a bot using the [C# SDK](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/csharp/builder/sdkreference/), [Node.js SDK](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/modules/_botbuilder_d_.html) or [REST API](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/restapi/connector/#navtitle).
2.	Test it using the [Bot Framework Emulator](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/tools/bot-framework-emulator/).
3.	Deploy the bot to a cloud service, such as [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/).
4.	[Register](https://dev.botframework.com/bots/new) the bot with the Microsoft Bot Framework, and click Add Skype for Business as a channel.  Enable the channel in the configuration page.
5.	Add the bot to a Skype for Business tenant by clicking Add to Skype for Business.

## Adding a bot to Skype for Business

Bots can only be added to Skype for Business by Tenant Administrators of a Skype for Business Online environment.  By clicking **Add to Skype for Business**, you will launch **[Connecting your bot to Skype for Business Online](https://skypeappregistration.azurewebsites.net/bot/29415286-5a43-4a00-9dc5-bcbc2ce1f59e)** page, which has the instructions for registering your bot. 

The instructions contain the following information:

To add your bot to Skype for Business, you must be the Tenant Administrator of a Skype for Business Online environment. A Tenant Administrator can easily add your bot by using the **[Skype for Business Admin PowerShell cmdlets](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn362831.aspx)**. Please complete the following steps to add a bot:

1. [Download and install the Skype for Business Online Connector module](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=294688)
2. Open Windows PowerShell as Administrator and run the following:

  ```PowerShell
   Import-PSSession (New-CsOnlineSession -Credential (Get-Credential))
  ```
> Note: To learn more about the PowerShell usage, see [Connecting to Skype for Business Online by using Windows PowerShell](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn362795.aspx).

3.	You will be prompted with windows PowerShell credential dialog box. Sign in using the tenant admin credentials.

4. Run the following PowerShell cmdlet

```PowerShell
 New-CsOnlineApplicationEndpoint -ApplicationID <AppID generated from BotFramework Portal like 41ec7d50-ba91-1208-73ee-136b88859725> -Name <NameOfTheBot> -Uri sip:<bothandle@yourdomain.com>
```

> Note: For the **Skype for Business Hybrid enviornment**, the **New-CsOnlineApplicationEndpoint** cmdlet will output additional on-premises cmdlet to be run in your [Skype for Business Server (on-premises) Management Shell](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg398474.aspx). For more information about bot setup for the Skype for Business Hybrid enviornment, see [Skype for Business Bot - Hybrid environment support](./Bot-Hybrid-Support.md).<p>
Also, Read [Skype for Business Bot - Common Errors](./Bot-Common-Errors.md) to troubleshoot some of the common Bot setup issues.</p> 

 
This cmdlet registers an instance of your bot with a Skype for Business Online tenant. A Skype for Business Admin can replace the **_Name_** parameter with their desired bot display name and replace the **_Uri_** parameter with a unique user account from their domain (eg. mybot@contoso.com)

>Note: A newly registered bot can take up to 8 hours to be discoverable by all users in the Skype for Business tenant. More details on using PowerShell to manage bots and apps for Skype for Business can be found [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/trusted-application-api/docs/trustedapplicationendpoint).

## Feature Support

- **Messages :**
Your bot can send plain text, HTML, and emoticons to a user or group. Users can send rich text, HTML, and emoticons to your bot.
- **Typing indicator :**
Your bot can send a typing indicator using the [C# SDK](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/csharp/builder/sdkreference/), [Node.js SDK](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/node/builder/chat-reference/modules/_botbuilder_d_.html) or [REST API](https://docs.botframework.com/en-us/restapi/connector/#navtitle) to tell the user that the bot is preparing to respond, for example when processing a request.
- **Basic format:**
The Skype for Business ID of a user is available for your bot, and is sent along with the _**display name**_ with every message.

```http 
{
  "type": "message",
  "timestamp": "2017-05-02T18:22:05.4521432Z",
  "serviceUrl": "https://webpoolbl20r02.infra.lync.com/platformservice/tgt-b5eccd26b71c5653a9f3e8faecd568db/botframework",
  "channelId": "skypeforbusiness",
  "from": {
    "id": "sip:user@contoso.com",
    "name": "Contoso User"
  },
  "conversation": {    "isGroup": true,
    "id": "ZmMyYmY4OGMjc2lwOmppZWluY29taW5nYm90ZXA4QDBtY29ycDJjbG91ZHBlcmYub25taWNyb3NvZnQuY2t"
  },
  "recipient": {
    "id": "sip:bot@contoso.com",
    "name": "sip:bot@contoso.com"
  },
  "text": "Hello World",
  "attachments": [],
  "entities": [],
  "replyToId": "2"
}
}
```
  The _**from**_ field contains the unique user Skype for Business identity _**Sip Uri**_ and _**user display name**_.

 The _**to**_ field contains the App Skype for Business identity _**Sip Uri**_ and _**bot display Name**_.
- **Skype for Business emoticons :**
Skype for Business emoticons can be sent by using emoticon keyword.
```http
{
  "text": ":)"
}
```
- **Cards and buttons :**
Skype for Business does not support rendering the cards and buttons . The Cards and buttons sent by a bot will fallback to text in the Skype for Business clients.

- **Groups :**
A bot can be enabled for groups in outgoing bot scenarios.  A bot can message multiple users in a group conversation.  Skype for Business does not support adding an additional participant to a 1:1 bot conversation. 

<a name="create-outbound-bots"></a>
## Creating outbound bots

Skype for Business bots can initiate outbound messages to users proactively because they are enabled by a Tenant Administrator.  In order to initiate an outbound message, your bot must be Skype for Business tenant-specific (your code must be written for a bot that will only be deployed in a single tenant. Eg. bot@contoso.com). 

 In addition, in order to initiate an outbound message, your bot must also have the Skype for Business identity of the user or users that bot will be messaging directly eg. user@contoso.com.
Your bot will also need to add the Skype for Business Channel entry point URL (https://api.skypeforbusiness.com/platformservice/botframework) to the Trusted Service URLs.
Here’s a code snippet that illustrates how to initiate an outbound message to a Skype for Business user using the C# Bot Builder SDK.

```cs
MicrosoftAppCredentials.TrustServiceUrl("https://api.skypeforbusiness.com/platformservice/botframework");     
to = new string[] {"sip:usera@contoso.com", "sip:userb@contoso.com"};
public async Task MakeOutboundCall(string[] to, string topic)
        {
            var connector = new ConnectorClient(new Uri(https://api.skypeforbusiness.com/ platformservice/botframework/)); //initial entry point to talk to the Skype for Business channel
            List<ChannelAccount> participants = new List<ChannelAccount>();
            foreach (string t in to)
            {
                participants.Add(new ChannelAccount(t, t + "name"));
            }
            ConversationParameters cpMessage = new ConversationParameters(true, new ChannelAccount(sip:bot@contoso.com, "DisplayNameofBot"),  participants, topic);
            ConversationResourceResponse  response = await connector.Conversations.CreateConversationAsync(cpMessage);
            ConversationId = response.Id;
            this.UpdateServiceUrl(response.ServiceUrl); //remember response ServiceURL to send additional message requests to the same conversation
        }
```

<a name="remove-bot-tenant"></a>
## Removing a bot – Skype for Business Tenant Administrator
To delete a bot completely from a Skype for Business Tenant, you must be the Tenant administrator of a Skype for Business Online environment. A Tenant administrator can easily delete your bot by using the Skype for Business Admin **[PowerShell cmdlets](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn362831.aspx)**. Complete the following steps to delete a bot:

1. [Download and install the Skype for Business Online Connector module](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=294688)
2. Open Windows PowerShell as Administrator and run the following:

 ```PowerShell
  Import-PSSession (New-CsOnlineSession -Credential (Get-Credential))
 ```

3.	You will be prompted with windows PowerShell credential dialog box. Sign in using the tenant admin credentials.

4. Run the following PowerShell 

```PowerShell
Remove-CsOnlineApplicationEndpoint -Uri sip:username@yourdomain.com
 ```

>Note: For more information see: [Connecting to Skype for Business Online by using Windows PowerShell](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn362795.aspx)

This command removes the instance of a bot with a Skype for Business Online tenant. A Skype for Business Admin must replace the Uri parameter with the user account from their domain (eg. mybot@contoso.com) , which they created when adding the bot.  More details on using PowerShell to manage bots and apps for Skype for Business can be found [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/trusted-application-api/docs/trustedapplicationendpoint).
