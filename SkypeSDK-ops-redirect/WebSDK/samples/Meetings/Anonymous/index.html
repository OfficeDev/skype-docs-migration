        <h3>Provide a conference URI to sign-in anonymously.</h3>
        <p>After bootstrapping the Skype Web SDK we have access to an api object which exposes an application object.  If we create a new instance of an application we get access to a signInManager.  The signInManager provides us with a signIn(...) method that we can supply a version, name, and meeting URI to authenticate anonymously.  When signing in through this method the application is limited to joining that specific meeting and will not have access to other features such as presence and contact management.</p>

        <h3>Click to join the meeting.</h3>
        <p>The application object exposes a conversationsManager object which we can use to get meeting conversations by calling getConversationByUri(...) and providing an online meeting URI.  After creation of the conversation object, it is helpful to setup a few event listeners for added participants and when we disconnect from the conversation.  In this example we demonstrate connecting to video so we also need to know when we are connected to video as well as any added participants.<p>
