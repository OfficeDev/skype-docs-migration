Additional IP Rights Grant (Patents)

""This implementation"" means the copyrightable works distributed by
Google as part of the Polymer project.

Google hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section)
patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,
transfer and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of this
implementation of Polymer, where such license applies only to those
patent claims, both currently owned or controlled by Google and acquired
in the future, licensable by Google that are necessarily infringed by
this implementation of Polymer.  This grant does not include claims
that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of
this implementation.  If you or your agent or exclusive licensee
institute or order or agree to the institution of patent litigation
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit) alleging that this implementation of Polymer or any code
incorporated within this implementation of Polymer constitutes
direct or contributory patent infringement, or inducement of patent
infringement, then any patent rights granted to you under this License
for this implementation of Polymer shall terminate as of the date
such litigation is filed."
