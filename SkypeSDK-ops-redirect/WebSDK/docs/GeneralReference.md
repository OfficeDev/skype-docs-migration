The Skype Developer Platform for Web ("Skype Web SDK") is a set of JavaScript Web APIs and HTML controls that enable you to build web experiences that seamlessly integrate a wide variety of real-time collaboration models leveraging Skype for Business services and the larger Skype network. In addition to support for multiple core collaboration services like presence, chat, audio, and video, it enables web experiences that can connect to a broad spectrum of users, browsing platforms, and device endpoints.

Skype Web SDK provides presence and chat services using new REST-based web services, which allows your Web SDK client app to be accessed on any browser such as IE, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Support for audio/video and application sharing conversations is currently supported via a downloadable plugin module that is available for Windows 7, Windows 8 computers and Macs. The net result is a powerful new model for building immersive collaboration experiences using the power of Skype and Skype for Business.
