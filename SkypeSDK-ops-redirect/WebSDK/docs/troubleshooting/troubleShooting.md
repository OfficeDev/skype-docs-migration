# Troubleshooting Skype for Business Web SDK applications

_**Applies to:** Skype for Business 2015_


Whether starting to develop a new Skype for Business Web SDK application or modifying an existing web application to add
a Skype for Business feature, you'll eventually find a technical issue that you need some troubleshooting help with. In talking
to developers, we've found that the most frequent troubleshooting issue is user authentication. This troubleshooting guide starts
with authentication issues and with your help, we'll add more troubleshooting topics. If you find that your issue is not covered 
in these topics, be sure to visit [Skype Web SDK GitHub page](https://github.com/OfficeDev/skype-docs/issues) to leave issues for
us, or ask questions related to the SDK on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/skypedeveloper) (use the 
tag **skypedeveloper**).
