# Key scenarios

In general, Trusted Application scenarios can be grouped into two categories:

1. **Your Service Application starts the scenario:** Your app starts sending requests to the Skype for Business Platform Service through the **Trusted Application API** to call a particular capability (eg. send an instant message)

2. **Skype for Business Online events start the scenario:** The Skype for Business Platform Service will send an event to your Service Application (eg. incoming instant message), indicating that Skype for Business received a request directed to your Service Application endpoint
