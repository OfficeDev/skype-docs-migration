<h1>Cache</h1>
<p>Cache is a simple library that utilizes a storage object to store data for use by other libraries or components.</p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>GeneralHelper.js</li>
  <li>MemoryStorage.js</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The Cache library is relatively standalone and can utilize user-created storage objects to store data. MemoryStorage is used as a default storage object when the object supplied to the constructor does not implement all required methods (init, create, read, update, delete). All Cache methods return a promise object to enable deferred processing of operations. Cache wraps the underlying storage object's methods exposing init, create, read, update, and delate.  When receiving the callback/promise result from data access methods create/update/delete will receive the id and read the data.</p>

<div id="module1"></div>

<h2>Storage Objects</h2>
<p>Storage objects implementing core methods (init, create, read, update, delete) can be used by the Cache. Each method is expected to return a promise object to allowed deferred processing. These methods are centered around data (what is being created/updated), id (identifier for the data), and callback (optional). Two implementations of a storage object have been provided with MemoryStorage (in-memory) and LocalStorage (HTML5's localStorage).</p>
