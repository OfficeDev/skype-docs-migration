<h1>Operation Resource</h1>
<p>Operation Resource is a library that wraps the Event and Transport libraries to handle the tasks required for UCWA operation resources. These tasks are:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Creating an operation ID</li>
    <li>Registering handlers with the Event modile for the operation ID in #1</li>
    <li>Issuing a request via Transport with the operation ID from #1</li>
</ol>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<ul>
    <li>GeneralHelper.js</li>
    <li>Transport.js</li>
    <li>Events.js</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>The Operation Resource libary provides a single method for starting an operation: startOperation(...). This method takes a request object, just like the one expected in Transport, comprised of: url, verb, acceptType, contentType, data, callback, etc. It also takes a handler object, like the one in Event, comprised of one or more event handlers. It performs the steps described above before returning the operation ID generated in step 1. It is possible to stop an operation via stopOperation(...) which takes the resulting Id from a startOperation(...) call removing the event handlers.</p>
