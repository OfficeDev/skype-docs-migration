<h1>Contact Search</h1>
<p>Contact search is a simple task that utilizes the Cache and Transport libraries to requests a set of contacts based on a search value and limit.  The resulting contacts will be limited if necessary or in cases where a search provides no results only link to search will be provided.</p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Cache.js</li>
    <li>Transport.js</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tasks</h2>

<h2 class="task">Search for Contacts</h2>
<p>Searching for contacts is a trivial task: use the Transport library to make a cross-domain request using a link stored inside the Cache library and provide a search value, limit, and callback to handle the result.  Depending on the result (200 with found contacts), the adjacent div will be populated with contacts (limited to 3 results).  Limiting the number of returned results can be controlled via a query string parameter seen in the sample code: "&limit=3".</p>
<div class="controls">
    <input data-enterBinding="searchContacts" id="contactSearchValue" />
    <a id="searchContacts" class="anchorButton">Search Contacts</a>
</div>
<div id="searchedContactsList"></div>
<div id="codeSnippet1"></div>
