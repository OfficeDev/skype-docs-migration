<h1>Events</h1>
<p>Events is a library that handles processing event messages, notifying event subscribers, and retrieving subsequent events. Events maintains a list of event handlers that receive calls when new event data has been processed.</p>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>GeneralHelper.js</li>
  <li>Cache.js</li>
  <li>Transport.js</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>In order to use the Events library a Cache and Transport object will need to be properly constructed. It is possible to provide an options object as the final parameter to the Events constructor which will configure the event request query parameters (low, medium, priority, and timeout) and this can be updated by calling updateEventOptions(...). Event processing can be started via startEvents() and stopped via stopEvents(). This call will make the initial request for events and handle retrieving event data, processing data, notifying event handlers, and retrieving the next event. Registering an event handler is done via addEventHandlers(...) which takes the supplied handler and adds it to an array of handlers that are notified whenever there is new event data that matches the provided trigger. Removing an event handler is done via removeEventHandlers(...) which takes a raiser and removes it and associated handlers from event processing.</p>
<p>Note that event data conforms to the familiar Transport request results. This module provides convenience functions around the results.</p>
