Schedule a "meet now" online meeting.


 _**Applies to:** Skype for Business 2015_

Scheduling a meeting involves resource navigation from [application](application_ref.md) to [myOnlineMeetings](myOnlineMeetings_ref.md). 

The steps here assume that you have already created an application and have received a response that contains the href for an [application](application_ref.md) resource. For more information, see [Create an application](CreateAnApplication.md).

1. Send a POST request on the **myOnlineMeetings** resource.
 
 A sample request is shown here. The data include meeting-specific information such as subject and attendees.
 
    ```
    POST https://lyncweb.contoso.com/ucwa/oauth/v1/applications/103...740/onlineMeetings/myOnlineMeetings HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/json
    Content-Type: application/json
    Authorization: Bearer cwt=AAEB...buHc
    X-Ms-Origin: http://localhost
    X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest

    "subject":"holiday party",
    "attendees": ["sip:Chris@contoso.com","sip:Alex@contoso.com"],
    "leaders": []
    }
    ```

2. Process the response from the previous POST request.
 
 The response you receive should be 200 OK. The body of the response contains meeting settings such as subject, description, invitees and organizer, and meeting ID.
