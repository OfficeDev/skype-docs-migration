# Update an online meeting
Update the details of a "meet now" online meeting.


 _**Applies to:** Skype for Business 2015_

To schedule a meeting, see [Schedule an online meeting](ScheduleAnOnlineMeeting.md).

The steps here assume that you have already created an application and have received a response that contains the href for an [application](application_ref.md) resource. For more information, see [Create an application](CreateAnApplication.md).

1. Send a PUT request on the myOnlineMeetings resource.
 
 A PUT request is used to update an existing online meeting. In contrast, a POST request is used to create a new online meeting. A sample request is shown here. Note that the etag is supplied in the If-Match header. If the meeting has changed on the server, this will trigger an error. The client should re-fetch the meeting and alert the user that the meeting has changed so she can resolve the changes.
 
    ```
    PUT https://lyncweb.contoso.com/ucwa/oauth/v1/applications/103985322388/onlineMeetings/myOnlineMeetings/PYC58WSY HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/json

    },
    "rel":"myOnlineMeeting",
    "etag":"3109609770",
    "attendanceAnnouncementsStatus":"Disabled"
    }
    ```

2. Process the response from the previous PUT request.
 
 The response you receive should be 200 OK. The body of the response contains a series of key-value pairs for the updated meeting. As was stated before, a 4xx response indicates that the meeting has changed on the server. The client should re-fetch the meeting and alert the user that the meeting has changed so she can resolve the changes.
