Search the **me** user's contact list for a specific contact.


 _**Applies to:** Skype for Business 2015_

Searching for a user's contact requires accessing the search resource. It involves resource navigation from [application](application_ref.md) to [people](people_ref.md) to [search](search_ref.md), specifying in the query parameter the email address of the specified contact and the maximum number of values to return. The programming flow is illustrated in the following steps.

The steps here assume that you have already created an application and have received a response that contains the href for an [application](application_ref.md) resource. For more information, see [Create an application](CreateAnApplication.md).

1. Send a GET request on the **search** resource following the links from **people** resource embedded in the **application** resource.
 
    ```
    GET https://lyncweb.contoso.com/ucwa/oauth/v1/applications/101/people/search?query=sarad@contoso.com&amp;limit=3 HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Bearer cwt=AAEB...buHcmvDs1Z7CzwgNEPoG3XyftjBYhE5zTT0buHc
    Accept: application/json
    X-Ms-Origin: http://localhost
    X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
    Referer: https://lyncweb.contoso.com/Autodiscover/XFrame/XFrame.html
    Accept-Language: en-us
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0)
    Host: lyncweb.contoso.com
    Connection: Keep-Alive

    ```

2. Process the response from the previous GET request to obtain the contact info.
 
 The response you receive should be 200 OK. The body of the response contains an array property named "contact" that is an array of individual contacts. Each item in the array includes information about a contact's URI, source network, and screen name, as well as links to other information about the contact.
 
    ```
