# Get my presence information
Get the presence of the **me** user.


 _**Applies to:** Skype for Business 2015_

Getting a user's presence involves resource navigation from [application](application_ref.md) to [me](me_ref.md) to [presence](presence_ref.md).

The steps here assume that you have already created an application and have received a response that contains the href for an [application](application_ref.md) resource. For more information, see [Create an application](CreateAnApplication.md).

1. Send a POST request on the makeMeAvailable resource.
 
 One of the hypermedia links that are served in the response for the [application](application_ref.md) resource is the href for the [makeMeAvailable](makeMeAvailable_ref.md) resource. Search for the [me](me_ref.md) resource embedded in your application, and then locate the href of the **makeMeAvailable** link.
 
    ```
    POST https://lyncweb.contoso.com/ucwa/oauth/v1/applications/101/me/makeMeAvailable HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/json
    Content-Type: application/json
    Authorization: Bearer cwt=AAEB...buHc
    X-Ms-Origin: http://app.contoso.com
    X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
    Referer: https://lyncweb.contoso.com/Autodiscover/XFrame/XFrame.html
    Accept-Language: en-us
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0)
    Host: lyncweb.contoso.com
    Content-Length: 37
    Connection: Keep-Alive
    Cache-Control: no-cache

    {"SupportedModalities": ["Messaging"]}
    ```

2. Process the response from the request in the previous step.
 
 The response you receive should be 204 No content, as shown here.
 
    ```
    HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
    Connection: Keep-Alive
    Date: Thu, 17 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT
    Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5
    Cache-Control: no-cache
    X-AspNet-Version: 4.0.30319
    X-MS-Server-Fqdn: W15-LYNC-SE1.contoso.com
    X-Powered-By: ASP.NET
    ```

3. Send a GET request on the **application** resource.
 
 A sample request is shown here.
 
    ```
    GET https://lyncweb.contoso.com/ucwa/oauth/v1/applications/101 HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Bearer cwt=AAEB...buHc
    Accept: application/json
    X-Ms-Origin: http://app.contoso.com
    X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
    Referer: https://lyncweb.contoso.com/Autodiscover/XFrame/XFrame.html
    Accept-Language: en-us
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0)
    Host: lyncweb.contoso.com
    Connection: Keep-Alive

    ```

4. Process the response from the previous request.
 
 The response from the previous GET request should be 200 OK. Look for the **me** embedded resource, which has a **presence** link. The href associated with the **presence** link is used in the next step.
 
    ```
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Connection: Keep-Alive

    "onlineMeetings":{...},
    "rel":"communication","etag":"29...41"}
    },
    "rel":"application"
    }
    ```

5. Send a GET request on the **presence** resource.
 
 A sample request is shown here.
 
    ```
    GET https://lyncweb.contoso.com/ucwa/oauth/v1/applications/103/me/presence HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Bearer cwt=AAEB...TT0buHc
    Accept: application/json
    X-Ms-Origin: http://app.contoso.com
    X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
    Referer: https://lyncweb.contoso.com/Autodiscover/XFrame/XFrame.html
    Accept-Language: en-US
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
    User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.2; Trident/6.0; .NET4.0E; .NET4.0C; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; InfoPath.3)
    Host: lyncweb.contoso.com
    DNT: 1
    Connection: Keep-Alive
    ```

6. Process the response from the previous GET request.
 
 The response you receive should be 200 OK. The body of the request contains an entry named availability that contains your presence, as well as a link to the **presence** resource.
 
    ```
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Connection: Keep-Alive
    Content-Length: 127
    Date: Thu, 17 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT

    {
    "availability": "Online",
    "_links":{
    "self":{"href":"/ucwa/oauth/v1/applications/103/me/presence"}
    },
    "rel": "presence"
    }
    ```
