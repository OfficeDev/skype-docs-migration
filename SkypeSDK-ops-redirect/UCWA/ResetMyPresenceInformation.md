# Reset my presence information
Reset the presence of the **me** user.


 _**Applies to:** Skype for Business 2015_

Resetting a **me** user's presence involves finding the embedded resource in the returned [application](application_ref.md) resource, and then finding the link to the [presence](presence_ref.md) resource.

The steps here assume that you have already created an application and have received a response that contains the href for an [application](application_ref.md) resource. For more information, see [Create an application](CreateAnApplication.md).

1. Send a POST request on the makeMeAvailable resource.
 
 One of the hypermedia links that are served in the response for the [application](application_ref.md) resource is the href for the [makeMeAvailable](makeMeAvailable_ref.md) resource. Search for the [me](me_ref.md) resource embedded in your application, and then locate the href of the **makeMeAvailable** link.
 
    ```
    POST https://lyncweb.contoso.com/ucwa/oauth/v1/applications/101/me/makeMeAvailable HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/json
    Content-Type: application/json
    Authorization: Bearer cwt=AAEB...buHc
    X-Ms-Origin: http://app.fabrikam.com
    X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
    Referer: https://lyncweb.contoso.com/Autodiscover/XFrame/XFrame.html
    Accept-Language: en-us
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0)

    Content-Length: 37
    Connection: Keep-Alive
    Cache-Control: no-cache

    {"SupportedModalities": ["Messaging"]}
    ```

2. Process the response from the request in the previous step.
 
 The response you receive should be 204 No content, as shown here.
 
    ```
    HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
    Connection: Keep-Alive
    Date: Thu, 17 Jan 2013 00:00:00 GMT
    Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5
    Cache-Control: no-cache
    X-AspNet-Version: 4.0.30319
    X-MS-Server-Fqdn: W15-LYNC-SE1.contoso.com
    X-Powered-By: ASP.NET
    ```

3. Send a GET request on the **application** resource.
 
 A sample request is shown here.
 
    ```
    GET https://lyncweb.contoso.com/ucwa/oauth/v1/applications/101 HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Bearer cwt=AAEB...buHc
    Accept: application/json
    X-Ms-Origin: http://app.contoso.com
    X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
    Referer: https://lyncweb.contoso.com/Autodiscover/XFrame/XFrame.html
    Accept-Language: en-us
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0)
    Host: lyncweb.contoso.com
    Connection: Keep-Alive

    ```

4. Process the response from the previous request.
 
 The response from the previous GET request should be 200 OK. The link that is of interest here is the **presence** link in the embedded **me** resource.
 
    ```
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Connection: Keep-Alive
    Date: Tue, 12 Feb 2013 19:24:27 GMT
    Server: Microsoft-IIS/7.5
    Cache-Control: no-cache
    X-AspNet-Version: 4.0.30319
    X-MS-Server-Fqdn: W15-LYNC-SE1.contoso.com
    X-Powered-By: ASP.NET

    {
    "culture":"en-US",

    "_links":{

    },
    "_embedded":{
    "me":{
    "name":"Dana Birkby",
    "uri":"sip:Dana@contoso.com",
    "emailAddresses": ["Dana@contoso.com"],

    "note":{"href":"/ucwa/oauth/v1/applications/104/me/note"},
    "presence":{"href":"/ucwa/oauth/v1/applications/104/me/presence"},
    "location":{"href":"/ucwa/oauth/v1/applications/104/me/location"},

    "phones":{"href":"/ucwa/oauth/v1/applications/104/me/phones"},
    "photo":{"href":"/ucwa/oauth/v1/applications/104/photos/Dana@contoso.com"}
    },
    "rel":"me"
    },
    "people":{...},
    "onlineMeetings":{...},
    "communication":{...},
    }
    "rel":"application"
    }
    ```

5. Send a POST request on the **presence** resource.
 
 Resetting one's presence amounts to sending a POST request on the **presence** link, with an empty body. This allows the system to set presence to the value that is appropriate based on your current activity, availability, and calendar information. A sample request is shown here.
 
    ```
    POST https://contoso.com/ucwa/oauth/v1/applications/102/me/presence HTTP/1.1
    Accept: application/json
    Content-Type: application/json
    Authorization: Bearer cwt=AAEB...uHc
    X-Ms-Origin: http://app.contoso.com
    X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
    Referer: https://contoso.com/Autodiscover/XFrame/XFrame.html
    Accept-Language: en-US
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
    User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.2; Trident/6.0; .NET4.0E; .NET4.0C; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; InfoPath.3)
    Host: lyncweb.contoso.com
    Content-Length: 25
    DNT: 1
    Connection: Keep-Alive
    Cache-Control: no-cacheGET https://lyncweb.contoso.com/ucwa/oauth/v1/applications/103/me/presence HTTP/1.1
    Authorization: Bearer cwt=AAEB...TT0buHc
    Accept: application/json
    X-Ms-Origin: http://app.contoso.com
    X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
    Referer: https://lyncweb.contoso.com/Autodiscover/XFrame/XFrame.html
    Accept-Language: en-US
    Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
    User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.2; Trident/6.0; .NET4.0E; .NET4.0C; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; InfoPath.3)
    Host: lyncweb.contoso.com
    DNT: 1
    Connection: Keep-Alive
    ```

6. Process the response from the previous POST request.
 
 The response you receive should be 204 No Content. This means that your presence request has been received by the server. An event will confirm that your application is the most active and this presence is now being shared with other contacts.
 
    ```
    HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
    Connection: Keep-Alive
