## Resource description
<a name = "sectionSection1"> </a>

This resource allows the application to keep track of members of the subscription. Updates include [presence](presence_ref.md), [location](location_ref.md), or [note](note_ref.md) changes for a specific contact.Additionally, an update on the event channel will inform the application that the subscription is about to expire. The application can then elect to refresh the subscription.Unlike [group](group_ref.md), presenceSubscription is not persistent and is typically relevant only for a short duration.
