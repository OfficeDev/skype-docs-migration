 _**Applies to:** Skype for Business 2015_

Only users homed on a Skype for Business Server 2015 pool can take advantage of UCWA 2.0 capabilities. 

Features such as Contacts, HD Photos, Voicemail and meetings are dependent on the version of Exchange Server; in this case, the features require Exchange Server 2013.
For more information about how to leverage Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 integration, see [Planning for Exchange Server Integration](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj721919.aspx).

 >Note: Microsoft Exchange Server 2013 integration leverages server-to-server authentication. Server-to-server authentication between an on-premises server and a Office 365 component is not supported in this Skype for Business Server 2015 release. Among other things, this means that you cannot set up server-to-server authentication between an on-premises installation of Skype for Business Server 2015 and Microsoft Exchange Online.
