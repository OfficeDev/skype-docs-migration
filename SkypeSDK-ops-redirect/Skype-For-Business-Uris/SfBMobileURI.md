# Skype for Business - Mobile URIs
Skype for Business Mobile URIs provide a simple way for you to initiate calls and chats using the Skype for Business mobile clients from websites and other apps.

For a Mobile URI to work, the Skype for Business mobile app must be installed on the userâ€™s device, and the user must have an active account. The most recent versions of Skype for Business iOS and Android support Mobile URIs. All interaction initiated by these Mobile URIs happens through the Skype for Business app.

Currently two-party chat, and audio calls can be initiated by Mobile URIs on Skype for Business iOS and Android. There is also a URI to launch the app.  Skype for Business Android additionally supports Mobile URI initiating video calls.

## General Syntax
A ms-sfb URI has the following general form: `"ms-sfb://" [operation] ["?" query ]`

The components are: 
- `operation = call / chat`
- `query =   [ "?" *(term "=" condition ) ]`
  - `term = 1*ALPHA`
  - `condition = 1*ALPHA`

>Note: If required parameters are missing or have invalid values, a 400 (bad request error) will be returned. Any additional/unknown parameters will be ignored.
